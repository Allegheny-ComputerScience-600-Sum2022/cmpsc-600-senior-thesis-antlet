# Abstract

Programmatic identifiers are used by software developers to assign names to entities in their programs. They provide the foundation of program comprehension and readability, so it is highly important that they are written clearly. Very few naming conventions exist that are required by programming languages, so developers and communities create clear names and standards on their own. Programmers develop this skill as they gain more experience, but the difficulty is high for those at the novice level. This research proposes [NamePy](https://github.com/ReadyResearchers/NamePy), a Python tool that examines and evaluates identifiers in novice source code to help them learn this skill. It is designed to be implemented at the continuous integration level for ideal results. This research also includes an evaluation of the tool via an experimental study. The study uses open source Python files to evaluate the effectiveness of the tool's ability to determine experience levels. Conclusions are drawn based on NamePy's results as compared to the expected results.
