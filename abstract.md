# Abstract

**Temporary Abstract**
Programmatic identifiers are used by software developers to assign names to entities in their programs. They provide the foundation of program comprehension and readability, so it is highly important that they are written clearly. There are not many naming conventions that are required by programming languages, so developers and communities create clear names and standards on their own. Programmers develop this skill as they gain more experience, but the difficulty is high for students. NamePy is a Python tool that examines and evaluates identifiers in students' source code to help them learn this skill. It is designed to be implemented at the continuous integration level for ideal results. This research also includes an evaluation of the tool via an experimental study. The study uses open source Python files to evaluate the effectiveness of the tool's ability to determine experience levels. Conclusions are drawn based on NamePy's results compared to the expected results.
<!-- Provide a concise summary of your proposed research of approximately 250
words. The abstract does _not_ serve as or replace the introduction; consider 
it a summary of the entire document. It makes sense to wait to write the abstract
until the rest of the document has been written. Write your abstract using
the `abstract.md` file, and the template will automatically include it. -->
