# Acknowledgment

This project would not have been possible without the help of those who supported me along the way. Many thanks to Professor Luman, Professor Oliver Bonham-Carter and the rest of the Allegheny College Computer Science Department for taking the time to assist me separately from all of the other students. This specialized help was crucial for allowing me stay on track with my academic journey, and it has not gone unnoticed. I could not have gotten to this point without the guidance of Professor Luman. His excitement for all of his students' projects and his helpful ideas make him an advisor that I would recommend to anyone. A huge thank you to my colleague and friend, Noor Buchi. His eagerness to help at every stage allowed me to expand this project beyond what I thought it could be. From bouncing ideas back and forth to working past my technical blockers, his help was vital and overwhelmingly appreciated. Lastly, a gigantic thank you to my partner and best friend, Michelle Miller. It was her push that enabled me to accomplish what I previously thought to be impossible.
